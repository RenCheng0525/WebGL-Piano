## Overview
A web-based interactive piano application that combines immersive 3D visualization with high-quality audio playback. Built with Three.js for 3D rendering and Tone.js for audio synthesis, the program parses MIDI files and synchronizes musical performance with visual effects.

## Features

### Visual Components
- **3D Piano Scene**: A realistic 3D piano environment with interactive keys.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Ambient, spot, and directional lights create realistic shadows and depth.
- **Key Glow Effects**: Each key features a glow effect to highlight activation during play.

### Audio Playback
- **High-Quality Audio**: Uses Tone.js Sampler to load and play piano samples.
- **MIDI File Support**: Custom MIDI parser extracts and schedules Note On/Off events.
- **Expressive Dynamics**: MIDI velocity controls volume for expressive and dynamic playback.

### Interactive Features
- **Direct Key Interaction**: Click on the 3D piano keys to trigger notes.
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, and stop MIDI playback with an intuitive interface.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator with the ability to jump to different parts of the performance.
- **Camera Control**: OrbitControls enable smooth camera rotation, zoom, and panning.

### Technical Highlights
- Built with **Three.js** for high-performance 3D rendering.
- Audio synthesis and effects managed by **Tone.js**.
- Custom MIDI parsing for real-time event scheduling.
- Responsive design ensures compatibility with both desktop and mobile browsers.
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

### Use Cases
- Interactive musical demonstrations
- Educational tool for learning MIDI and piano performance
- Visualizing music composition and performance in real-time
- Showcasing the integration of 3D graphics and audio processing

### Implementation Details
- **3D Rendering**: Custom models for piano keys, lighting, and camera controls.
- **MIDI Parsing**: A dedicated parser processes MIDI headers, tracks, and events.
- **Audio Engine**: Tone.js handles note triggering, reverb effects, and dynamic volume control.
- **User Interaction**: Raycasting and mouse event handlers enable direct manipulation of keys and camera.

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with WebGL support.
- Fully compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
